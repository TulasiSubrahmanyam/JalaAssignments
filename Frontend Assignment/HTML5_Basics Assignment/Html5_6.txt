In HTML, both the <span> and <div> elements are used as containers to group content. However, there are some key differences between them:

Purpose: The <span> element is used to group inline elements (such as text or images) together, whereas the <div> element is used to group block-level elements (such as paragraphs or headings) together.

Size: The <span> element has no inherent size, meaning it only takes up the amount of space required by its contents. The <div> element, on the other hand, creates a block-level container that takes up the full width of its parent container by default.

Styling: The <span> element is typically used to apply styles to individual pieces of content (such as changing the color of a single word in a sentence), whereas the <div> element is typically used to apply styles to larger sections of content.

Nesting: The <span> element can be nested inside other inline elements, whereas the <div> element cannot be nested inside other block-level elements.

In summary, the <span> element is used for inline grouping and applying styles to individual pieces of content, while the <div> element is used for block-level grouping and applying styles to larger sections of content.
