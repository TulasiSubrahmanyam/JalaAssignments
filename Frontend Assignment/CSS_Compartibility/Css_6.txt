A table structure consists of columns (fields), rows (records), and cells, organized in a grid-like format. Columns have names and represent types of data, rows contain data related to specific items or entities, and cells are individual data points. Tables may have primary keys (unique identifiers), foreign keys (referencing primary keys of other tables), and data types (specifying the format of data in each column). Understanding table structure is crucial for managing and querying data effectively.
