In CSS, the outline-style property is used to set the line style for the outline of an element.

The outline-style property can take a variety of values, including:

dotted: Creates a dotted line outline
dashed: Creates a dashed line outline
solid: Creates a solid line outline
double: Creates a double line outline
groove: Creates a 3D groove outline
ridge: Creates a 3D ridge outline
inset: Creates a 3D inset outline
outset: Creates a 3D outset outline
The default value for outline-style is none, which means that no outline is displayed.

button {
  outline-style: dotted;
}
